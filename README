CS194 Fall 2015 Project
CUDA optimization of pigz

Currently, "Hello World!" is printed whenever deflate_slow() function
is called in zlib.


"make -j" under each folder to build its source code.

1. Now CUDA Toolchain is required to build zlib.
   Make sure CUDA is installed under /usr/local/cuda

2. You can add .cu files into zlib folder now.
   To let cuda functions runs in zlib, write cuda related code in .cu files only.
   Write a corresponding .h file and that the zlib source code includes that .h
   and then call the cuda function in zlib function.

3. Don't add extra .cu files to zlib folder because currently Makefile compiles
   all .cu files in that folder.

4. It is not required to rebuild pigz if zlib is rebuilt

TODO:
1. New added .h files are not detected by Makefile. Therefore, if you have
   made a changes in newly added .h files only, then make, you may encounter
   "Nothing to be done for all" error. You can do "make clean" then "make -j"
   to solve this problem.
