CUDA optimization of pigz

1. Now CUDA Toolchain is required to build this.
   Make sure CUDA is installed under /usr/local/cuda

2. Make sure environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   includes /usr/local/cuda/lib64 and THIS_REPO/zlib
   THIS_REPO means the absolute location of this repo's root
   folder in your disk.

   HOWTO:
   
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:THIS_REPO/zlib

   Then add the above commands to the file "~/.bashrc", then reboot.

   If you don't do this, you will encounter "cannot find shared library"
   error while trying to execute executables.
