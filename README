CUDA optimization of pigz

Currently, "Hello World!" is printed whenever deflate_slow() function
is called in zlib.


"make -j" under each folder to build its source code.

Oct 24 2015

1. Now CUDA Toolchain is required to build zlib.
   Make sure CUDA is installed under /usr/local/cuda

2. Make sure environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   includes /usr/local/cuda/lib64 and THIS_REPO/zlib
   THIS_REPO means the absolute location of this repo's root
   folder in your disk.

   HOWTO:
   
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:THIS_REPO/zlib

   Then add the above commands to the file "~/.bashrc", then reboot.

   If you don't do this, you will encounter "cannot find shared library"
   error while trying to execute executables.

3. You can add .cu files into zlib folder now.
   To let cuda functions runs in zlib, write cuda related code in .cu files only.
   Write a corresponding .h file and that the zlib source code includes that .h
   and then call the cuda function in zlib function.

4. Don't add extra .cu files to zlib folder because currently Makefile compiles
   all .cu files in that folder.

5. It is not required to rebuild pigz if zlib is rebuilt

TODO:
1. New added .h files are not detected by Makefile. Therefore, if you have
   made a changes in newly added .h files only, then make, you may encounter
   "Nothing to be done for all" error. You can do "make clean" then "make -j"
   to solve this problem.
