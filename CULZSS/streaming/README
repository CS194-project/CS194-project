*          CUDA LZSS test program
*
*   File    : main.c
*   Purpose : Using  CUDA based compression functionality to test compression/decompression 
*   Authors  : Adnan Ozsoy, Martin Swany, Arun Chauhan,Indiana University - Bloomington
*   Update	: December 2012 (last update date)
*   Usage   : 
*           : make
*           :
*           : ./test 
*				-i {number of iterations} 
*				-f {input file} 
*				-b {number of blocks(4 is recommended)} 
*           : Example  ./main -f ESG.data -i 100 -b 4  
*           :    Compressed file is written into 128COMPRESSED.dat 
*			:	 The program for now only accepts input files with the size of power of 2. Testing is done on sizes of 128MB.
