This file contains the TODO list that are not explicitly mentioned as "TODO: "
in our source code files.

1. Fixing our kernel to write length of compressed data process by each CUDA thread.
   I think we have to know exact size in bits because the compressed data won't be
   in multiple of bytes. I do not fully understand how LZSS figures out when to stop
   decoding, but I'm assuming sequential version stops compressing when it reaches EOF.
   In this case, it just knowing size by bytes won't generate any problem, but in our
   case, since we are appending each thread's compressed data, we have to know exact
   bits to copy. I tried compressing with our versioi and decompressing with origianl,
   but ouput was not readable at all. Base on my understanding, if we don't have any
   other bug, at least very first part (processed by thread 0) of the data should be 
   identical to original text file.

2. Seems like it segfaults inside the kernel. This bug might existed when we
   were using sigle thread in CUDA (we never had error checking and syncing after the
   kenel call before). I suspect that this is related to the bug that misses
   last character of the file. Abhishek can take a look at this.
